# Variables
  Variables are the same as variables in math, except math variables are often letters, but programming variables could be words.

### Note about variable declaration:
 - Case-sensitive;
 - MUST start with either a letter or underscore; CANNOT start with numbers;
 - CANNOT be the same name as Python Keywords (e.g. calss, finally, etc.);
 - do NOT specify type od information stored in the variable (*Refer to the following codes for an example*);

In []: 

    # Exemple of variable declarations
    width = 10
    	 
    # Notice the "H" is capitalized
    Height = 5
    area = 0
In []: `print(width)`
Out []: 10
